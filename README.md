# Senior-Project-Partial
This repository ia a sample of my Senior Project. Included within is the front-end portion of an application that was developed as a tool for organizing and providing a visual aid to the complex task of creating a schedule of classes for a college major. 

The Project has two view modes: one a classic time-date weekly calendar view which is best used to visualize time and day(s) of classes, the other is a hierarchical tree view that allows an overview of all the classes and sections in a major. The tree view is helpful for editing details other than day and time (section number, professor, location etc). 

Editing was implemented in both modes, and managed by reducers (Redux) to reflect edits across modes. Approved changes would be reflected in the (test) database. 

The Project uses JavaScript Libraries D3 and React/Redux. D3 was chosen for its ability to process otherwise overwhelming data comprehensively. React/Redux were chosen to manage multiple states to allow for editing.
